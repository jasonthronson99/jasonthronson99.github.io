  <h1>My Favorite Books:</h1>

  <h2>Book 1: Python Crash Course</h2>

  <h2>Book 1 Reasoning</h2>
  <p>
  When people have told me that they have a hard time with learning Python, I was really confused. I remember struggling for a little bit myself, but one day it became a breeze. I realized that this was because they haven't heard about this book. Now I know that one aspect of programming is the actual problem solving part, and yes that's very difficult, but in terms of learning the syntax, this book makes python extremely easy. I honestly think that it's the definitive beginner resource (or at least the first few chapters are, since I remember the project part being annoying).

  <h2>Book 2: The Illustrated Happiness Trap</h2>

  <h2>Book 2 Reasoning</h2>
  <p>
  So I feel like there are a lot of books on happiness nowadays, and that's great. However I've noticed that they tend to run into two issues: they're either too boring/long, which makes reading them not worth it in my opinion, or they're not really based on any science. This book fixes that by providing science-based advice for happiness (known as acceptance commitment therapy, great stuff), while also providing lots of illustrations to make understanding the material fun, and making it easier to get through.

  <h2>Book 3: Atomic Habits</h2>

  Everyone needs to read this book. This book is one of the books that changed my life so much.
