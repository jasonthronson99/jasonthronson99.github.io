  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>
  Hi there! My name's Jason Thronson, nice to meet you. Right now I'm a junior studying Information Science at UW Madison. I'm not 100% sure what I want to do for my future career, but right know I'm leaning towards being a systems administrator for a while, and then eventually transferring to software engineering. So my main goal right now is getting my RHCSA certification and working as either help desk or a junior sysadmin for the summer, then maybe doing some leetcode on the side so I can try to get a software engineering internship.
