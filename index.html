  <p>
  Hi there! My name's Jason Thronson, nice to meet you. Right now I'm a junior studying Information Science at the UW Madison. I'm not sure what I want to do as my future career, but I know that my main goal right now is getting my RHCSA certification and working as either help desk or a junior sysadmin for the summer.
