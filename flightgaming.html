  <h1>My Favorite Games For Long Flights</h1>

  <h2>Intro</h2>
  <p>
  Okay so I used to be someone who was addicted to video games. The only thing that would make me feel good was either playing a video game by myself, or with friends. This ended up changing though, as after discovering positive habits like meditation and exercise, I permanently stopped playing video games. I had noticed that playing video games was making me feel bad, so instead of gradually reducing them, I cut them cold turkey. For a few years, I really didn't touch any video game at all (the only thing I would do is sometimes watch a video related to video games on YouTube). However, there was an issue that I was experiencing. Whenever I would fly anywhere, I would be SO BORED. Even if I downloaded books, downloaded TV shows, or just anything, I would be bored out of my god dang mind. So after a lot of consideration, I decided that if I was traveling by plane, or if I needed to take a bus somewhere for more than an hour, I would have some games on my computer that I could play (only if I was bored of everything else). This decision of mine inspired me to make this list, as now I look forward to flying instead of being bored for the entirety of them.

  <h2>The Games</h2>
  <p>
  For the following games that I've chosen for this list, they're based on a few key principles: they have to be entertaining for the whole flight as opposed to just a few minutes, they have to run well on any modern phone or any modern computer (I'll have a few games for the phone and a few games for the computer), they're either free or very very cheap, and they don't rely on online connection. With all that being said, here are the games:
  </p>

  <h2>Game 1 For Phone: Pokemon Black 2 (Or Pokemon White 2)</h2>
  <p>
  If there is any pokemon game that you should consider playing, it needs to be this one. The advantages are as follows: there is a LOT of content (so much that you can do), I find that it's very easy to get into for most people, and just in general you can tell that the developers put so much effort into it. Although there are some pokemon games with better graphics out there (like Let's Go Pikachu or Let's Go Eevee), I feel like they lack the passion that came with this game.
  </p>

  <h2>Game 2 For Phone: New Super Mario Bros</h2>
  <p>
  This game's very underrated. Even though it's for the DS, it has amazing graphics, and it's the only game in the NSMB series that I find myself coming back to (for single player). What makes this game so special is not just the level design, but the amount of secrets in this game. I think it's so cool that in order to get to world 4, you have to beat a boss with a certain power up. Although the other NSMB games are good, I feel like this game has the most polish, despite it being the oldest.

  <h2>Game 3 For Phone: Plants Vs Zombies</h2>
  <p>
  It seems like most people know this game, but I just thought I'd share my love. It's very easy to get into, has a lot of content while not being too hard, and is just in general a fun game. I also like the zen garden feature, as it makes the game very replayable. I prefer the first two games, but this is a good option if they don't sound too appealing.
  </p>

  <h2>Game 1 For Computer: Sonic Adventure</h2>
  <p>
  I know that the Sonic series is a pretty controversial one, and especially the game in question, but I will defend this game until the day I die. This game isn't as polished as the ones that come after it, but the control of this game is spectacular. I will admit that the story for this game isn't good (and that the non-sonic levels aren't that great), but unlike the second sonic adventure, you can access all the sonic levels while never having to play another character.
  </p>

  <h2>Game 2 For Computer: Super Smash Brothers Brawl</h2>
  <p>
  Despite this game being hated by some, this game has the advantage in that it has an amazing storyline (I love the subspace emissary so much), and that the combat is accessible to new players. The other smash games have either no good story mode, or the gameplay is just too difficult for new players.
  </p>

  <h2>Game 3 For Computer: Kingdom Hearts</h2>
  <p>
  There's one reason why I'd recommend this game to everyone: it's a great story, and with disney characters. It really is so funny seeing Goofy and Donald Duck in this serious adventure story. I also find the gameplay to be very fun.
