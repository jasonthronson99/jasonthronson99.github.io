  <h2>Reasoning:</h2>
  <p>
  When people have told me that they have a hard time with learning Python, I was really confused. I remember struggling for a little bit myself, but one day it became a breeze. I realized that this was because they haven't heard about this book. Now I know that one aspect of programming is the actual problem solving part, and yes that's very difficult, but in terms of learning the syntax, this book makes python extremely easy. I honestly think that it's the definitive beginner resource (or at least the first few chapters are, since I remember the project part being annoying).
